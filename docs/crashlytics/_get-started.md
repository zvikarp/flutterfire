This quickstart describes how to set up {{firebase_crashlytics}} in your app
with the {{crashlytics}} Flutter plugin so that you can get comprehensive crash
reports in the {{name_appmanager}}.

Setting up {{crashlytics}} involves using both a command-line tool and your IDE.
To finish setup, you'll need to force a test exception to be thrown to send your
first crash report to Firebase.


## Before you begin {: #before-you-begin}

1.  If you haven't already,
    [configure and initialize Firebase](/docs/flutter/setup) in your Flutter
    project.

1.  **Recommended**: To automatically get
    [breadcrumb logs](/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports#get-breadcrumb-logs)
    to understand user actions leading up to a crash, non-fatal, or ANR event,
    you need to enable {{firebase_analytics}} in your Firebase project.

    * If your existing Firebase project doesn't have {{firebase_analytics}}
      enabled, you can enable {{firebase_analytics}} from the
      {{firebase_console_integrations_link}} of your
      <nobr><span class="material-icons">settings</span> > _Project settings_</nobr>
      in the {{name_appmanager}}.

    * If you're creating a new Firebase project, enable {{firebase_analytics}}
      during the project creation workflow.

    Note that breadcrumb logs are available for all Android and Apple platforms
    supported by {{crashlytics}} (except watchOS).

## **Step 1**: Add {{crashlytics}} to your Flutter project {: #add-sdk}

1.  From the root of your Flutter project, run the following command to install
    the Flutter plugin for {{crashlytics}}.

    To take advantage of
    [breadcrumb logs](/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports#get-breadcrumb-logs),
    also add the Flutter plugin for {{firebase_analytics}} to your app.
    Make sure that
    [Google Analytics is enabled](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/9289399#linkga){: .external}
    in your Firebase project.

    ```sh {: .devsite-terminal .devsite-click-to-copy data-terminal-prefix="your-flutter-proj$ " }
    flutter pub add firebase_crashlytics && flutter pub add firebase_analytics
    ```

1.  From the root directory of your Flutter project, run the following command:

    ```sh {: .devsite-terminal .devsite-click-to-copy data-terminal-prefix="your-flutter-proj$ " }
    flutterfire configure
    ```

    Running this command ensures that your Flutter app's Firebase configuration
    is up-to-date and, for Android, adds the required {{crashlytics}} Gradle
    plugin to your app.

1.  Once complete, rebuild your Flutter project:

    ```sh {: .devsite-terminal .devsite-click-to-copy data-terminal-prefix="your-flutter-proj$ " }
    flutter run
    ```

1.  _(Optional)_ If your Flutter project uses the `--split-debug-info` flag
    (and, optionally, also the `--obfuscate` flag), additional steps are
    required to show readable stack traces for your apps.

    * **Apple platforms:** Make sure that your project is using the recommended
      version configuration (Flutter 3.12.0+ and
      {{crashlytics}} Flutter plugin 3.3.4+) so that your project can
      automatically generate and upload Flutter symbols (dSYM files) to
      {{crashlytics}}.

    * **Android:** Use the [{{firebase_cli}}](/docs/cli) (v.11.9.0+) to upload
      Flutter debug symbols. You need to upload the debug symbols _before_
      reporting a crash from an obfuscated code build.

      From the root directory of your Flutter project, run the following
      command:

      <pre class="devsite-terminal" data-terminal-prefix="your-flutter-proj$ ">firebase crashlytics:symbols:upload --app=<var class="readonly">FIREBASE_APP_ID</var> <var class="readonly">PATH/TO</var>/symbols</pre>

      * <var>FIREBASE_APP_ID</var>: Your Firebase Android App ID (not your
        package name)<br>
        Example Firebase Android App ID: `1:567383003300:android:17104a2ced0c9b9b`

          {{ '<section class="expandable">' }}
          <p class="showalways">Need to find your Firebase App ID?</p>

          > Here are two ways to find your Firebase App ID:
          >
          > * In your `google-services.json` file, your App ID is the
          >   `mobilesdk_app_id` value; or
          >
          > * In the {{name_appmanager}}, go to your
          >   [_Project settings_](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/){: .external}.
          >   Scroll down to the _Your apps_ card, then click on the desired Firebase
          >   App to find its App ID.

          {{ '</section>' }}

      * <code><var>PATH/TO</var>/symbols</code>: The same directory that you
        pass to the `--split-debug-info` flag when building the application


## **Step 2**: Configure crash handlers {: #configure-crash-handlers}

You can automatically catch all errors that are thrown within the Flutter
framework by overriding `FlutterError.onError` with
`FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterFatalError`:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await Firebase.initializeApp();

  // Pass all uncaught "fatal" errors from the framework to Crashlytics
  FlutterError.onError = FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterFatalError;

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

To catch asynchronous errors that aren't handled by the Flutter framework, use
`PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError`:


```dart
Future<void> main() async {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await Firebase.initializeApp();
    FlutterError.onError = (errorDetails) {
      FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterFatalError(errorDetails);
    };
    // Pass all uncaught asynchronous errors that aren't handled by the Flutter framework to Crashlytics
    PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError = (error, stack) {
      FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError(error, stack, fatal: true);
      return true;
    };
    runApp(MyApp());

}
```

For examples of how to handle other types of errors, see
[Customize crash reports](/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports?platform=flutter).


## **Step 3**: Force a test crash to finish setup {:#force-test-crash}

To finish setting up {{crashlytics}} and see initial data in the {{crashlytics}}
dashboard of the {{name_appmanager}}, you need to force a test exception to be
thrown.

<<_force-test-crash.md>>

  If you've refreshed the console and you're still not seeing the test crash
  after five minutes,
  [enable debug logging](test-implementation#enable-debug-logging)
  to see if your app is sending crash reports.

<br>
And that's it! {{crashlytics}} is now monitoring your app for crashes and, on
Android, non-fatal errors and ANRs. Visit the
[{{crashlytics}} dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/crashlytics){: .external}
to view and investigate all your reports and statistics.


## Next steps {:#next-steps}

* [Customize your crash report setup](/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports)
  by adding opt-in reporting, logs, keys, and tracking of additional non-fatal
  errors.

* [Integrate with {{play_name}}](/docs/crashlytics/integrate-with-google-play)
  so that you can filter your Android app's crash reports by {{play_name}} track
  directly in the {{crashlytics}} dashboard. This allows you to better focus
  your dashboard on specific builds.

* [View stack traces and crash statistics alongside your
  code](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features#aqi){: .external}
  with the _App Quality Insights_ window in Android Studio (available starting
  with Electric Eel 2022.1.1).
